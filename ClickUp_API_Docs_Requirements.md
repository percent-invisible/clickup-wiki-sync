# ClickUp API Document Syncer - Requirements and Notes

---

## 1. ClickUp Links Formats

- Doc link:  
  `https://app.clickup.com/{workspace_id}/v/dc/{doc_id}`

- Page link:  
  `https://app.clickup.com/{workspace_id}/v/dc/{document_id}/{page_id}`

- Linked page link:  
  `https://app.clickup.com/{workspace_id}/docs/{document_id}/{page_id}`

---

## 2. API Response Properties of Interest

- `name`
- `content` (use `content_format=text%2Fmd` when fetching a document)
- `workspace_id`
- `doc_id`
- `id`
- `pages` (nested page tree structure)

---

## 3. API Request Example

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.clickup.com/api/v3/workspaces/18003214/docs/h5d8e-3374/pages?max_page_depth=-1&content_format=text%2Fmd' \
     --header 'Authorization: CLICKUP_API_KEY' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

## 4. Markdown URL Patterns

### Allowed

- **Regular Markdown Links:**  
  `[link text](url)`  
  Example:  
  `[Select Field](https://app.clickup.com/18003214/v/dc/h5d8e-3194/h5d8e-17314)`

- **Empty Markdown Links (for computed fields):**  
  `[](url)`  
  Example:  
  `[](../../1.ARC-Find-A-Church-Map.md)`

- **Nested Markdown Links:**  
  `[text]([text](url))`  
  These are less common but appear in some complex formatting scenarios.

- **Markdown Links in Table Cells:**  
  `| cell | [text](url) |`  
  Example:  
  `| Field Type | Status Indicator ([Status Indicator](../../../../Field-Types-Glossary/requirements/Display-Fields/8.Status-Indicator.md)) |`

### Not Handling

- Image Markdown Links:  
  `![](image_url)`  
  Example:  
  `![](https://t18003214.p.clickup-attachments.com/t18003214/ccff9171-44d8-4dd4-9c18-0a6974221409/image.png)`

- Phone Links:  
  `[phone number](tel:phone_number)`  
  Example:  
  `[+1 (715) 111-2222](tel:+17151112222)`

- Task Links:  
  Example:  
  `[HUB: Church - ARC Find-A-Church Map Calculated Status](https://app.clickup.com/t/86b2t0yxc)`

---

## 5. Page Tree Structure Requirement

- The API response includes a nested `pages` tree structure.
- Pages may act as folders; in that case, create them as both a page and a folder.
- Example structure from existing data:

```
- ARC Find-A-Church Map (page + folder)
  - Agreements (page)
  - The Workflow Card (page + folder)
    - Fields (page + folder)
      - Status (page)
      - Agreement Start Date (page)
      - Agreement Age (page)
      - Form Last Sent (page)
      - Form Response Accepted (page)
      - Notes (page)
    - Activity Feed Items (page + folder)
      - HUB: Church Activity - ARC Find-A-Church Map Form Sent (page)
      - HUB: Church Activity - ARC Find-A-Church Map Form Unsent (page)
      - HUB: Church Activity - ARC Find-A-Church Map Form Accepted (page)
      - HUB: Church Activity - ARC Find-A-Church Map Form Rejected (page)
      - HUB: Church Activity - ARC Find-A-Church Map Status Override Changed (page)
      - HUB: Church Activity - ARC Find-A-Church Map Status Override Removed (page)
  - Data Backfill (page)
  - Status Override (page)
  - HUB: Church - ARC Health Plan (page)
  - HUB: Campus - Remove Lead Team Override Feature (page)
  - Dev Notes (page)
  - Scratchpad (page)
```

---

## 6. Project and Build Setup

- **Tech Stack:** TypeScript project with dependencies.
- **Build and Distribution:**
  - Use `npm` as the package manager.
  - Project folder structure: `src` and `dist`.
  - Target ECMAScript version: ES2023.
  - Use the latest TypeScript version.
  - Build tool is flexible; pick best fit (e.g., `tsc`, `esbuild`, `vite`, etc.).

---

## 7. Markdown Parser

- Use an existing robust markdown parser library to avoid building one from scratch.
- Example: [`markdown-it`](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) or [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark).

---

## Summary

This document captures all requirements for a ClickUp API docs syncer project that fetches nested docs and pages in markdown format, handles various ClickUp link patterns, interprets nested page structures (including pages that act as folders), and processes markdown links carefully. The TypeScript project setup includes an appropriate build system targeting ES2023, and the implementation should leverage existing markdown parsing libraries.
